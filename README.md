# Magentify

[Capistrano](http://capify.org) is an open source tool for executing commands on multiple servers in parallel. It is intended to be used to easily deploying applications. While it was built specifically for deploying Rails apps, it is designed to be easily extended to deploy any type of application or run any number of commands. This project is a deployment recipes collection that works specifically with [Magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/).

## Installation

    $ gem install magentify
    
## Project setup

    $ magentify .

## Usage

Once you have run `magentify` on your project it will add a Capfile and deploy.rb configuration file

```ruby
set :application, "magento"
set :domain,      "#{application}.com"
set :deploy_to,   "/var/www/#{domain}"

set :user,        "deploy"
set :repository,  "git@github.com:user/project.git"
set :scm,         :git

role :web,        "000.000.000.000"   # Your HTTP server, Apache/etc
role :app,        "000.000.000.000"   # This may be the same as your `Web` server or a separate administration server

set  :keep_releases,  3

set :app_symlinks, ["/media", "/var", "/sitemaps", "/staging"]
set :app_shared_dirs, ["/app/etc", "/sitemaps", "/media", "/var", "/staging"]
set :app_shared_files, ["/app/etc/local.xml"]
```

Once you have magentified your project you can run:

    $ cap -T
    
This will list all the available tasks that can be run with a shot description. For more detailed information about each of the tests run:

    $ cap -e [task_name]
